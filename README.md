*   **Extensible Tool Integration:** Equip agents with a vast array of tools for web scraping, data access, code execution, image generation (DALL-E), and more. Easily add custom tools to extend capabilities.
*   **Customizable LLM Support:** Integrate with various Large Language Models, allowing you to choose the best model for each agent's specific needs.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Monitor agent interactions and task progressions with a robust event listener system, providing deep insights into execution.
*   **Evaluation & Observability:** Tools for evaluating agent performance and integrating with observability platforms (Langfuse, MLflow) to fine-tune your crews.
*   **CLI & Deployment:** A powerful Command Line Interface for quick setup, deployment, and management of your multi-agent systems.

## Who is this for?
`crewAI` is ideal for:
*   **AI Developers & Engineers:** Building complex, intelligent applications requiring agent collaboration.
*   **Researchers:** Experimenting with multi-agent systems, collective intelligence, and emergent behaviors.
*   **Data Scientists:** Automating research, analysis, and data-driven decision-making processes.
*   **Product Teams:** Crafting innovative AI products with advanced reasoning and task execution capabilities.
*   **Anyone** looking to leverage the full potential of AI agents beyond single-prompt interactions.

## Technology Stack & Architecture
`crewAI` is built primarily with **Python**, leveraging the following key components:

*   **Core:** Python 3.9+
*   **LLMs:** Integrates with various Large Language Models (OpenAI, Hugging Face, custom LLMs) via `src/crewai/llm.py` and `src/crewai/llms`.
*   **Pydantic:** Used extensively for data validation and settings management (e.g., in `src/crewai/utilities/pydantic_schema_parser.py`).
*   **Vector Databases:** Supports ChromaDB (`src/crewai/rag/chromadb`) and Qdrant (`src/crewai/rag/qdrant`) for RAG functionalities.
*   **Memory Storage:** Utilizes SQLite (`src/crewai/memory/storage/ltm_sqlite_storage.py`) for long-term memory.
*   **Tooling:** An extensible framework for integrating diverse tools for various tasks, categorized in `docs/en/tools` (AI/ML, Automation, Cloud Storage, Database, File/Document, Search/Research, Web Scraping).
*   **CLI:** Built with `click` (implied by `src/crewai/cli/cli.py`) for command-line interactions.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
The `crewAI` framework orchestrates intelligent agents, tasks, and tools to achieve complex goals. At its core, a **Crew** manages **Agents**, each with specific **Roles** and **Goals**. These Agents perform **Tasks** using available **Tools**, with their interactions and learning facilitated by an advanced **Memory** system and external **Knowledge Bases**.

**Database Schema (Inferred from File Structure):**
`crewAI`'s flexible architecture allows for various data persistence strategies.
*   **Memory Storage:**
    *   **Long-Term Memory:** Implemented using SQLite (`ltm_sqlite_storage.py`), likely storing episodic memories, learned behaviors, and key facts.
    *   **Contextual/Short-Term Memory:** Managed in-memory or through specialized handlers for immediate task context.
*   **Knowledge Bases (RAG):** Integrates with external vector databases like ChromaDB and Qdrant, which manage and store embeddings for document retrieval. While not directly part of the `crewAI` internal database, they are critical for information access.
*   **Flow Persistence:** State of execution flows can be persisted, enabling resumability (`flow/persistence/sqlite.py`).

## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get started with `crewAI`, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Installation:**
    ```bash
    pip install crewai
    ```

2.  **Set up your Environment Variables:**
    Configure your LLM API keys (e.g., OpenAI API key) in a `.env` file or directly in your script.
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'
    ```

3.  **Create your first Crew:**
    Define your agents, tasks, and the crew that orchestrates them in a Python script.
    ```python
    from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
    from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

    # Define your tools
    search_tool = SerperDevTool()

    # Define your agents
    researcher = Agent(
        role='Senior Researcher',
        goal='Uncover groundbreaking technologies in AI',
        backstory='A seasoned researcher with a knack for identifying revolutionary tech.',
        tools=[search_tool],
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=False
    )

    writer = Agent(
        role='Tech Content Writer',
        goal='Produce engaging and informative articles on AI advancements',
        backstory='A skilled writer capable of translating complex tech into compelling narratives.',
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=True
    )

    # Define your tasks
    task1 = Task(
        description='Identify the top 3 emerging AI technologies in 2024.',
        expected_output='A ranked list of the top 3 emerging AI technologies, with a brief explanation for each.',
        agent=researcher
    )

    task2 = Task(
        description='Write a compelling blog post about the highest-ranked technology from Task 1.',
        expected_output='A 500-word blog post, optimized for engagement.',
        agent=writer
    )

    # Instantiate your crew
    tech_crew = Crew(
        agents=[researcher, writer],
        tasks=[task1, task2],
        process=Process.sequential, # or Process.hierarchical
        verbose=2 # You can set it to 1 or 2 for different levels of verbosity
    )

    # Kickoff the crew
    print("ðŸš€ CrewAI is starting up...")
    result = tech_crew.kickoff()
    print("\n\n########################")
    print("## Here is the Final Result")
    print("########################\n")
    print(result)
    ```

This example demonstrates a simple sequential process where a `researcher` identifies technologies and a `writer` then drafts a blog post.
